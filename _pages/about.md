I have grown up being obsessed with language in all its forms, especially the way languages influence the way we think. My full-time hobbies of reading and writing have also influenced my full-time job working with language at [Adobe](https://www.adobe.com), India. My current work lies at the intersection of AI and its explainability, psychology, creativity, and marketing. 

With my [new book](https://amzn.in/d/htecc96) out, I remain uncertain about what it means for creativity in the age of AI. [Do I want AI to do my laundry while I do my art?](https://x.com/AuthorJMac/status/1773679197631701238?lang=en) Yes. But do I also want to build creative AI that can be used to advance research in various disciplines? Yes. Fueled by these opposing emotions but mainly a desire to understand our own brains, I am excited about research in explainable AI and its use in various disciplines across language cultures and communities.
