With the rise of the digital age, the access that individuals have to the news has increased exponentially. This is undoubtedly great for the democratic process. However, what seems to be a huge flaw in the implementation of this has been the bias which exists within the media houses themselves. Individuals, unbeknownst to the bias in the news they read, are pigeonholed into a situation where truth to them is simply what media houses find will flare up their readership. In the process, we see massive misinformation campaigns , which crumble the democratic process by creating divisive, sensationalised news. Motivated by this problem, I worked on creating a tool which promises to provide the reader with the necessary context that they need before reading an article i.e its political bias. The code and additional project details can be found <a href="https://github.com/alt-nikitha/NewsMediaBiasDetection">here.</a>
