<a href="https://business.adobe.com/products/genstudio-for-performance-marketing.html"> Adobe GenStudio </a> is a Generative AI application that allows marketing teams to create high performance content. I initially worked on a GenStudio Insights proof-of-concept to recommend content for <a href="https://www.adobe.com/express/"> Adobe Express </a>. An A/B test showed +100% sign up CTA clicks, +65% marquee CTA clicks, +22% template clicks, +37% downloads, +33% MAU in express with my proof-of-concept recommendations. GenStudio Insights works by using AI to extract features studied in marketing and psychology research from advertisements and uses this predict what resonates with different audiences.  My current work as part of GenStudio Insights involves the creating taxonomies for each feature and training of models to detect them from the language in marketing content. I have also led and mentored intern projects to improve these trained models and make them explainable. Our post-hoc explanations are extracted using standard interpretability techniques such as SHAP, LIME, and combined with signals from the internal weights of the model. These explanations overlap 15% more with human-annotated explanations than traditional baselines. I am excited to explore inherently interpretable models in future research.
