<a href="https://business.adobe.com/products/genstudio-for-performance-marketing.html"> Adobe GenStudio </a> is a Generative AI application that allow marketing teams to create high performance content. I initially worked on a GenStudio Insights proof-of-concept for <a href="https://www.adobe.com/express/"> Adobe Express </a> that further cemented its usefulness after an A/B test. My current work as part of GenStudio Insights involves the training of models that detect features from the text part of marketing content that are useful to understand its performance.  My work also involved leading and mentoring intern projects to improve these trained models and make them explainable.
