I worked on a Question Answering system for privacy policy documents using deep learning. This question answering system is then made interpretable with the use of saliency maps and perturbation analysis. This enables users to ensure that the answers obtained are grounded in the right sections of the policy document. It also adds accessibility, transparency, and trust.
