<a href="https://www.adobe.com/express/"> Adobe Express </a> is an end-to-end AI content creation tool. I have worked on the integration of intelligent capabilities into the product. I have developed and deployed the search suggestions feature in the asset panel of the editing workflow. This is provided based on the metadata of assets being used in the current creation. These search suggestions brought about 8% more traffic in the first week with users being 15% more likely to export the creation and stick through the whole workflow. As part of a demo for future capabilities in Adobe Express, I have also worked on training hashtag and caption recommendation systems for publishing creations on social media. This combines instruction fine-tuning with preference signals from engagement of social media posts. This end-to-end workflow of creation, publishing, obtaining feedback on performance was a finalist in <a href= "https://blog.adobe.com/en/publish/2022/10/19/adobe-max-sneaks-show-how-ai-is-enhancing-future-of-creativity">Adobe MAX Sneaks 2022 </a>.
