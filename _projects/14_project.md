Proteins are large molecules that are responsible for many activities in our cells, tissues, organs, and bodies and they also play a central role in the structure and function of cells. Proteins are composed of 20 types of smaller molecules known as amino acids, which are ordered in a long chain known as the protein amino acid sequence. Each protein has its own sequence that determines its structure and its function. We aim to build a model that predicts what a protein does based on its amino acid sequence. These predictions will help researchers understand how proteins function, and could lead to the development of new medical treatments and therapies. This work will be submitted to the <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/cafa-6-protein-function-prediction/overview">Kaggle Critical Assessment of Protein Function Annotation (CAFA) challenge </a>
