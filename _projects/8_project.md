This work was done during a 3-month summer internship where I researched geometric spaces and their ability to store information for processing. I developed an algorithm for hierarchical topic modeling by combining information from embeddings in hyperbolic and Euclidean space. I also worked on automatically labeling the topics produced in the hierarchy. We were able to beat baselines in terms of topic interpretability, coherence, granularity across the hierarchy, topic diversity, and memory and time efficiency. I published a findings paper at ACL 2023 {% cite shahid-etal-2023-hyhtm %} on this, a poster {% cite shahid-et-al-poster %} at NeurIPS 2021 WiML workshop, and a patent {%cite Nikitha2024%}. I also developed an algorithm to label these hierarchical topics. This research was used to understand the readability and depth of content with respect to various reader segments.
